# Heater Control System - upliance.ai Internship Assignment

This project simulates a heater control system using Arduino and FreeRTOS. A potentiometer simulates temperature input. Based on thresholds, the system transitions between states: IDLE, HEATING, STABILIZING, TARGET REACHED, and OVERHEAT.

## Features
- State machine implementation with FreeRTOS tasks
- Heater LED and Status LED indicators
- Serial logging of temperature and states
- Potentiometer as LM35 simulator
